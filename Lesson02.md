# Lesson #02 - PHP Basics
![](image)

   
## Learn
* PHP is Extended HTML

### Technology We Know
* HTML Provides Website Structure
* CSS Provides Website Style
* JS Provides Programming Logic

### What is missing?

### Client/Server Computing
* Logic can run remotely - Server
* Logic can run in the browser - Client

### Example: Form validation
* Server can check all the data for completeness
* JavaScript can check the page before posting results

### HTML is stateless
* Every page to a URL is the same
* 1000 users all get the same page
* Applications must remember things

### PHP Allows Saved Memory
Example:

```
What is your name? __Mark__   Submit

Welcome, Mark
```

### PHP Allows Complex Rendering
Example:

```
What is your name? __Mark__   Submit

Welcome, Mark   Last Login: June 20
```


## Plan
* Build HTML pages
* Add CSS for style
* Add logic where required
* Version Control - save every version of every file

* Use Brackets to edit a file ~/Documents/BACS_350/web-root/exercise/ex2.php
* Add code to file 

```
<h1>My Home Page</h1>
<p>This is just HTML</p>
```

### Step 2 - Test the page
* Push the code to the remote server
* Browse the URL to your file

```
```
